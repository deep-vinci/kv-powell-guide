### Guide

Day 1

- css by default is always responsive
- use relative units instead of px

- em uses parent font size and rem uses root html font size 
- em/rem for anything other than font-size works little differently (https://youtu.be/_-aDOAMmDHI?si=C3Qf6SbAGFkunFAb&t=390)
- em looks at the element font size instead of parents font size 
- don't use heights
